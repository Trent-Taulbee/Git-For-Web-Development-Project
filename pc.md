## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1: Git is a tool used for source code management. It allows for collaboration on projects for multiple programmers and developers.

2: Git is where you can make changes to certain files and programs locally on your computer. Github is the cloud from which projects are pulled

3: creating a branch allows you to edit codes and texts before applying it back to the working code so that it can be trouble shooted and experimented with safely.

4: a pull request allows you to notate what changes were made to the project you are working on.

5: git switch -c [main]

6: "Git Fetch" downloads all history, "git merge" combines branches into the current local branch, "git pull" updates the current local branch with new commits.

7: a merge conflic is when multiple separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file.

8: in github under the repository name click pull requests. Select the merge conflict then select "resolve conflicts"
